# Webdriver Session

This package is intended to help the developer with webdriver instances, such as downloading updates automatically, session settings and remote instances.

## Installation

# execute in root path of project
python -m pip install .
# FROM GIT
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/joismar/webdriver_session.git
```

## Usage example

```python
from webdriver_session import ChromeSession

session = ChromeSession(
  profile_folder=False, # True if you want to generate profile folder inside the project folder and persist it
  download_path=None, # path for files downloaded in browser
  driver=None, # if you want to specify a custom webdriver class
  args=[], # if you want pass browser args, equivalent to options<ChromeOptions>.add_argument('--argument_here')
)

# get a new browser, a webdriver file will download automatically
browser = session.get_browser()

browser.get('https://google.com')
```
